# Flappy_bird
it is a website which is similar to flappy bird game
Let me explain how it works step by step:

1. **Element Selection:**
   - The code starts by selecting three HTML elements with the `getElementById` method: "block," "hole," and "character." These elements are presumably part of the game's HTML structure.

2. **Variables Initialization:**
   - `jumping` and `counter` are initialized to 0. `jumping` is used to control whether the character is currently jumping, and `counter` keeps track of the player's score.

3. **Hole Animation Event Listener:**
   - An event listener is added to the "hole" element for the "animationiteration" event. This event is triggered when a CSS animation iteration completes. When this event occurs, the code generates a random value for the "top" property of the "hole" element, effectively moving the hole to a new random position, and increments the `counter` to increase the score.

4. **Game Loop (setInterval):**
   - The main game loop is set up using `setInterval`. This loop runs every 10 milliseconds.
   - Inside the loop, the code:
     - Checks the character's current position.
     - Moves the character downward slightly (if not jumping) by modifying the "top" property.
     - Retrieves the positions of the block, hole, and character.
     - Checks if the character hits the ground or collides with the block. If a collision is detected, the game is over, and an alert is displayed with the player's score. The character's position is reset, and the `counter` is reset to 0.

5. **Jump Function:**
   - The `jump` function is defined to handle character jumps. When called, it sets the `jumping` flag to 1, and then uses `setInterval` to repeatedly move the character upwards by changing its "top" property. It also keeps track of the jump count and stops the jump animation after a certain number of iterations, setting `jumping` back to 0.

In summary, this code creates a simple game where the player controls a character to jump through holes in a moving block. The game loop continuously updates the game state, and the player's score increases each time a hole animation completes an iteration. If the character falls to the ground or collides with the block, the game is over. The `jump` function handles character jumps.
